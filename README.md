# Vue.js Notes App

I created this app to learn Vue.js from scratch and explore various technologies in the Vue ecosystem.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3:** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **@nhost/vue, @nhost/apollo, @apollo/client, graphql, @vue/apollo-composable:** Used for integrating GraphQL API into the Vue application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and customizable user interfaces.
- **Vue Router:** Provides navigation for different routes based on user authentication status.
- **GraphQL:** Utilized for performing queries and mutations to create, read, and delete notes.
- **NHost:** Implements methods for creating new users, logging in/out, and other authentication functionalities.

## Features

- **Vue-Router:** Enables navigation between different routes for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- **GraphQL:** Performs queries and mutations to handle the creation, reading, and deletion of notes.
- **NHost:** Implements methods for creating new users, logging in/out, and managing user authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Provides a visually appealing and responsive design for the application.
